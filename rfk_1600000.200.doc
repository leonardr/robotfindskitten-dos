THE NICETIES
------------
    Hi there. This is the documentation file for robotfindskitten v1600000.3,
winner (by default) of the first Nerth Pork robotfindskitten contest. The
object of the contest was to create a work of art whose title and/or theme
was "robotfindskitten". I chose to write this program, which is a Zen
simulation. That's what Pete Peterson calls it, and that's really the best
way to describe it, even though "Zen simulation" sounds kinda pretentious.
Anyway, let's dispense with the niceties and get on with the documentation.

THE DOCUMENTATION
-----------------
    In this simulation, you play the part of robot. Your task is to complete
the simulation by finding kitten, as is your destiny, and indeed your wont.
You (robot) are represented by the # character, and you move around with the
arrow keys touching things.  If the thing you touch is kitten, you get a cute
little animation and the simulation ends. Otherwise, you get a brief
description of what it is you touched. So far, there are 200 non-kitten
objects in the simulation, thus the subversion number 200. Future versions
will have more objects and thus higher subversion numbers.

THE PARTS OF THE SIMULATION
---------------------------
    The first part of the simulation is the command line used to invoke it. It
is here where you can control the number of non-kitten objects on the screen
in any one instance of the simulation. To excersize this control, simply enter
a number between 0 and 200 inclusive on the command line. For instance, to
play with 32 objects on the screen, you would invoke the program with the
command "robot 32". If you're a Win95 user and don't know how to use the
command line, what can I say? You'll just have to live with the default of 20
non-kitten objects.

    The second part of the simulation is the title screen. It should be fairly
self-explanatory.

    The third part of the simulation is the actual simulation itself. The long
line near the top of the screen separates the screen into the field of play
and the status bar. The status bar displays messages and item descriptions.
Just so you don't wonder what that line is.

     The fourth part of the simulation... there isn't one. It's not a very
complicated simulation.

CONTROLS
--------
1. To move robot, use the arrow keys. Diagonals don't work, sorry. What do
   you need diagonals for, anyway? It's not like there's a maze you have to
   run through or anything. Oy, you kids today. When I was your age, all we
   had were ones and zeros. And sometimes we'd run out of zeros, and we had
   to use just ones.

2. To touch an object, make a move as if you were trying to occupy the square
   currently occupied by the object you want to touch. Sorry if that seemed
   obvious, but you never know. I don't want to be accused of writing
   incomplete documentation.

3. If you want to end the program for whatever reason, just hit Escape.

A WORD OF WARNING
-----------------
    Danger!

ANOTHER WORD OF WARNING
-----------------------
    The characters you see on the screen are not guaranteed to correspond in
shape or color to what the descriptions say they are. In fact, they're pretty
much guaranteed not to. If there was any consistency, it'd be pretty easy to
spot kitten every time, now wouldn't it?


TECHNICAL INFORMATION FOR HARD-CORE GEEKS
-----------------------------------------
     I wrote this using Borland Turbo C++ 3.0 for DOS. I'd like to do a Linux
version, but I'm still a Linux newbie so don't expect anything in the
immediate future. If you'd like to help, I'd be most grateful. It's good that
you're a hard-core geek like me. I can speak frankly to you, knowing that
non-coders won't read this section, or will be scared off by all that jargon
in the first few sentences. Our plan is nearly complete, and we are poised to
take our rightful places as rulers of this planet. Already we control the
technology of the sheeplike masses. We merely await the command from Geek
Central, and Earth will be ours! AH HA HA HA HA HA! Uh-oh, that evil laughing
looks kind of conspicuous in a doc file. I better put in some more technical
info. A Linux port would mainly involve rewriting the graphics stuff, probably
to use ncurses, since I used a TC++ library which I sincerely doubt is
avaliable on Linux. Now, let us part with the secret geek handshake!


JOIN THE BLUDGEONING robotfindskitten COMMUNITY!
------------------------------------------------
    I want robotfindskitten to be the most comprehensive Zen simulation on
the market. But for that to happen, I need your help. Please, send in any
descriptions of objects you would like to see in robotfindskitten to
leonardr@ucla.edu. Heck, you could even tell me to put you in the program!
I'm certainly not above that sort of thing. Pete has set a great example by
providing over 30 objects for everone's kitten-finding enjoyment. Also, be
sure to tell me how you like robotfindskitten.

A FINAL THOUGHT
---------------
"Day and night I feverishly worked upon the machine, creating both a soul
which could desire its goal, and a body with which it could realize it. Many
who saw my creation called it an abomination, and denied me grant money. But
they could not dissuade me from my impossible task. It was a spectre that
tormented me always, a ghost I had to give a form and a life, lest it consume
me from the inside. And when at last my task was done, when the grey box on
wheels was complete and when it, as well as I, knew what had to be done, I
felt deep sympathy for the machine. For I had not destroyed the phantom,
but merely exorcized it into another body. The robot knew not why this task
had to be performed, for I could not imbue it with knowledge I did not myself
posess. And at the same time, I felt a sweeping sense of relief sweep over me,
that somehow, the dream that had driven me for my entire life had come one
step closer to fruition.

"As I vocally activated the robot, I realized that the it was following my
instructions, but not out of any desire to obey me. Had I remained silent, it
would have performed exactly the same operations. We were two beings
controlled by the same force now. And yet, seeking vainly to hold some
illusion of control over the machine I thought I had created, I gave my
final command.

"`GO!' I told the box as it began to roll out of my workshop into the frozen
desert beyond. `FIND KITTEN!'"
