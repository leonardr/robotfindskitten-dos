# robotfindskitten-dos
The very first implementation of robotfindskitten, written for MS-DOS in 1997.

This repository contains
`rfk_original_submission_1600000.3-robot.zip`, the original submission
to the Nerth Pork robotfindskitten contest, created on June 29,
1997. That ZIP archive contains two files, `ROBOT.DOC` and
`ROBOT.EXE`.

The source code for `ROBOT.EXE` is lost, but `rfk_1600000_145-robot.cpp`
seems to be exactly the same except for the addition of four
non-kitten items. Note that the "shameless plug for Nerth Pork" is
missing its URL because I didn't know which URL Pete wanted me to use.

The other files in this repository represent further versions of
robotfindskitten, some of which may never have been compiled or
released.

`robot200.exe` has the version number 1600000.200, and includes a
unique "Play again?" feature. I believe it is the final released
version of DOS robotfindskitten, but the source code is lost.
